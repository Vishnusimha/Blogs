1.Spring vs Spring Boot:

Spring is a comprehensive framework for building enterprise Java applications. It provides support for various modules
such as dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, data access, transaction management, and more.

Spring Boot, on the other hand, is a framework built on top of the Spring framework that aims to simplify the process of
setting up and configuring Spring applications. It provides conventions and auto-configurations, reducing the need for
manual configuration and boilerplate code.

2. What is Spring Boot and mention the need for it:

Spring Boot is an opinionated framework designed to simplify the development and deployment of Spring-based
applications. It aims to provide a streamlined experience by reducing configuration overhead and allowing developers to
quickly bootstrap Spring applications.

The need for Spring Boot arises from the complexity and verbosity of configuring Spring applications manually. Spring
Boot eliminates much of this complexity by providing default configurations and sensible conventions, allowing
developers to focus more on writing business logic rather than configuring the application.

3. Advantages of Spring Boot:

   Simplified configuration: Spring Boot provides auto-configuration and sensible defaults, reducing the need for manual
   configuration.
   Rapid development: With Spring Boot's convention over configuration approach, developers can quickly bootstrap
   projects and start coding.
   Embedded servers: Spring Boot includes embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, allowing applications to be
   easily packaged and deployed as standalone JAR files.
   Production-ready features: Spring Boot includes features like metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration,
   making applications production-ready out of the box.
   Integration with Spring ecosystem: Spring Boot seamlessly integrates with other Spring projects like Spring Data,
   Spring Security, and Spring Cloud.

4. Features of Spring Boot:

   Auto-configuration: Spring Boot automatically configures beans based on classpath and property settings.
   Embedded servers: Spring Boot includes embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow.
   Dependency management: Spring Boot manages dependencies through starter POMs.
   Externalized configuration: Spring Boot allows configuration to be externalized using property files, YAML files,
   environment variables, or command-line arguments.
   Actuator: Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features like monitoring, metrics, and health checks.

5. How to create a Spring Boot application using Maven:

To create a Spring Boot application using Maven, you can use the Spring Initializr web tool or the Spring Boot CLI.
Alternatively, you can manually configure a Maven project with Spring Boot dependencies.

Here's how you can create a Spring Boot application using Maven manually:

    Create a new Maven project:

    bash

mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=my-spring-boot-app
-DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false

Add Spring Boot starter dependencies to pom.xml:

xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>

Create a main class with @SpringBootApplication annotation:

java

    package com.example;

    import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
    import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

    @SpringBootApplication
    public class MySpringBootApplication {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SpringApplication.run(MySpringBootApplication.class, args);
        }
    }

6. Possible sources of external configuration:

Spring Boot allows external configuration to be provided from various sources:

    Property files: application.properties or application.yml
    YAML files: application.yml
    Environment variables
    Command-line arguments
    Profile-specific property files (e.g., application-dev.properties for the dev profile)
    Custom property sources using @PropertySource annotation

7. What happens in the background when a Spring Boot Application is “Run as Java Application”:

When a Spring Boot application is run as a Java application, Spring Boot's embedded server (e.g., Tomcat) is started,
and the application context is initialized based on auto-configurations and component scanning. Spring Boot scans the
classpath for beans and auto-configures them based on the presence of certain dependencies and properties.

8. Spring Boot starters and available starters:

Spring Boot starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that allow you to quickly set up and configure
common use cases in Spring applications. Some available starters include:

    spring-boot-starter-web: Starter for building web applications using Spring MVC.
    spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: Starter for using Spring Data JPA.
    spring-boot-starter-security: Starter for securing Spring applications using Spring Security.
    spring-boot-starter-test: Starter for testing Spring Boot applications.
    spring-boot-starter-actuator: Starter for using Spring Boot Actuator.

9. Spring Actuator and its advantages:

Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features to monitor and manage Spring Boot applications. Some advantages
include:

    Health checks: Provides insights into the health of application components.
    Metrics: Exposes metrics about application behavior and performance.
    Auditing: Tracks and exposes information about HTTP requests.
    Environment details: Exposes information about application properties and environment variables.
    Custom endpoints: Allows developers to create custom management endpoints for specific monitoring needs.

10. Spring Boot dependency management:

Spring Boot dependency management simplifies dependency management in Spring Boot applications by providing a set of
curated dependencies and their corresponding versions. This allows developers to declare dependencies using starter POMs
without worrying about version conflicts or compatibility issues. Additionally, Spring Boot's dependency management
plugin automatically manages versions and dependencies, reducing the need for manual configuration.

## what is system design ? what questions interviewer may ask a spring boot developer on this topic ?

System design refers to the process of designing the architecture, components, and interactions of a software system to
meet specified requirements. It involves making decisions about various aspects such as scalability, reliability,
performance, security, and maintainability. System design encompasses both high-level architecture design and low-level
component design.
